# Iris-EDA

## Project Goal:
**Iris** has become an extremely popular dataset for beginners to learn the basics of visualization and machine learning, and unfortunetly most of the time one ends up reinventing the wheel using it. My goal for this project was to showcase a completly new approach you can visualize this data presented, discovering new possibilities and new ways you can research something that has been done before a millions of times. First, I wanted to explore Plotly library and see if by manipulating data right I would be able to create unqiue graphs to tell a story. Second, to develop 2D representations of classification algorithm and its decision boundary.
